With this option enabled, you can now log into DSM and access your music from anywhere.You can also use your <b>QuickConnect ID</b>
to log into DS Audio to save the hassle of having to memorize your IP address. </p>
<h4>3.1 Library</h4>
<p> The library contains music in the <b>music</b> shared folder or any other indexed folders of your Synology NAS. In the <b>Library</b> tab, your music is sorted  into categories to provide you with different options  to easily browse your music according to your needs and preferences. As well as this, it will allow you to easily find any song you are looking for. You can click into each category to conduct your search or select the category you want to search within from the drop-down menu in the search bar. </p>
