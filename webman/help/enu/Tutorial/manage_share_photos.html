<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Photo Station is a web-based application designed to help you organize and view photos stored on your Synology NAS over the Internet. With its refined and user-friendly interface, Photo Station allows you to upload, browse, manage, and share your photo albums in just a few simple clicks.</p>

<h3 class="list_head">1. Install Photo Station</h3>
<p>To install Photo Station, please go to <b>Package Center</b>, find <b>Photo Station</b>, and then click <b>Install</b>.</p>

<h3 class="list_head">2. Upload Photos</h3>
<p>Before you can browse and manage photos in Photo Station, you need to create albums and upload photos with any of the following methods first.</p>

<h4>2.1 Upload photos via Photo Station Uploader (for Windows and Mac)</h4>
<p>We recommend you use Photo Station Uploader because thumbnails of each photo to display will be generated during the uploading process. Uploading files via Photo Station Uploader will leverage the computing ability of your computer to speed up the conversion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <b>Photo Station Uploader</b> (available at <a href="https://www.synology.com/support/download/DS713+" target="_blank">Synology's Download Center</a>).</li>
<li>On your computer, right-click on any photos you want to upload, and choose <b>Upload to Photo Station</b> > <b>Create new profile</b> to open the wizard.</li>
<li>Enter a name of your own choice and the server name/IP address of the destination Synology NAS for the new profile.</li>

<div class="code_div">
<b>Note:</b>
<p>The server information and user credentials provided will be saved to this profile for future use. You can set up several profiles according to different rules or destinations. Instead of filling in server information again the next time you use Photo Station Uploader, you can select an existing profile and use its configurations set up previously to upload photos to the same destination.</p>
</div>

<li>Choose whether you want to upload the files to Photo Station or Personal Photo Station.</li>

<li>Enter the user credentials for the destination Synology NAS.</li>

<li>Click <b>Browse</b> to choose a destination folder or create a sub-folder under the <b>photo</b> shared folder.</li>

<img src="../../images/ManagePhotos/1x/manage_share_photos/3.png" border="1"/>

<li>Once the upload is completed, you can launch Photo Station on your Synology NAS and view the uploaded files in various modes or edit other information, such as album properties and access privileges.</li>
</ol>


<h4>2.2 Create albums and upload photos via Photo Station</h4>
<p>Launch <b>Photo Station</b>, and click <b>Add</b> to create a new album or upload photos from your computer or Synology NAS to existing albums.</p>

<div class="code_div">
<b>Note:</b>
<p>If you prefer uploading photos via the Photo Station interface, it is highly recommended that you enable QuickConnect service. Whether you are at home or on the move, QuickConnect allows you to access your Synology NAS and Photo Station from anywhere via the Internet with a custom ID yet without the hassle of having to set up complicated network configurations, such as port forwarding rules. For more information about QuickConnect, please refer to <a class="launch-app" href="cloud_set_up_quickconnect.html">this tutorial</a>.</p>

</ul>
