<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>With Video Station, you can easily organize and categorize your video collections into different default or custom libraries, so as to find the video you want much more efficiently. In addition, playing and sharing videos can be just as easy and straightforward as a few simple clicks.</p>

<h3 class="list_head">1. Install Video Station</h3>
<p>To install Video Station, please go to <b>Package Center</b>, find <b>Video Station</b>, and then click <b>Install</b>.</p>

<img src="../../images/HomeTheater/1x/home_theater_videos/1.png" border="1"/>

<h3 class="list_head">2. Store and Categorize Videos into Default Libraries</h3>
<p>Video Station provides three default libraries as shown on the left panel: <b>Movie</b>, <b>TV Show</b>, and <b>Home Video</b>. To make sure your videos can be correctly indexed and categorized, you need to add video folders for each library and then store your  files to the corresponding video folders first. By default, three video folders have been created under the <b>video</b> shared folder for the three default libraries: <b>movie</b>, <b>TV show</b>, and <b>home video</b>. However, in addition to these three folders, you can also do the following to add more video folders for the libraries.</p>

<div class="code_div">
<b>Note:</b>
<p>The system will automatically search related metadata and other information (e.g. poster image) for two video types (movie and tv show) from the Internet. Thus, to ensure your videos can be paired with the correct information, it is highly recommended that the videos should match the specified video type of their respective libraries.</p>
</div>

<h4>Add video folders for default libraries</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>Library</b>.</li>

<img src="../../images/HomeTheater/1x/home_theater_videos/2.png" border="1"/>

<li>Click <b>Create</b> > <b>Add folder</b> to choose a folder from your Synology NAS, and select the destination library. You can add up to 100 video folders for one library, but once a folder is selected, neither the folder nor its sub-folders can be selected for another library anymore.</li>

<img src="../../images/HomeTheater/1x/home_theater_videos/3.png" border="1"/>

<li>Store video files to video folders to categorize videos into corresponding libraries.</li>
<li>Now you can browse and watch your desired videos from the libraries!</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="list_head">3. Store and Categorize Videos into Custom Libraries</h3>
<p>In addition to the three default libraries which can be accessed by anyone by default, you as DSM <B>admin</B> or users belonging to the <b>administrators</b> group can also create custom libraries and assign access permissions to users.</p>

<h4>3.1 Create custom libraries</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>Library</b>, and click <b>Create</b> > <b>Create library</b>.</li>

<img src="../../images/HomeTheater/1x/home_theater_videos/4.png" border="1"/>

<li>Specify a name for the new library, select which type of videos you want to put in the folder, and then choose <b>Public</b> if you want the library to be accessed by everyone, or choose <b>Private</b> to limit the access to particular users who have permissions. Please note that the videos you place in the folder must match the type selected here to ensure the accuracy of video information collected from the Internet.</li>
<li>If you chose <b>Private</b>, click <b>Assign permissions</b> and tick the checkboxes to grant access to the users.</li>
</ol>

<h4>3.2 Add video folders for custom libraries</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>Library</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Create</b> > <b>Add folder</b> to choose a folder from your Synology NAS, and select the destination library. You can add up to 100 video folders to one library, but once a folder is selected, neither the folder nor its sub-folders can be selected for another library anymore.</li>
<li>Store video files to video folders to categorize videos into corresponding libraries.</li>
<li>Now you can browse and watch your desired videos from the libraries!</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="list_head">4. Play Videos</h3>
<p>Once you have categorized your video files into different libraries, you can follow the steps below to play your videos on Video Station. It is highly recommended that you install <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank">VLC media player (Windows, Linux)</a> on your computer first. In addition to playing videos on your local computer, you can also stream your videos to DLNA/UPnP-compliant DMAs or AirPlay compatible devices for video playback.</p>

<li>Select any video clip you want to play, and then click the play icon on the video image, or click <b>Action</b> > <b>Play</b>.</li>

<li>Use the on-screen buttons and progress bar at the bottom of Video Player according to your need. You can also adjust the volume, select video playback quality and audio track, turn subtitles on, or stream the video to another device (if applicable).</li>
