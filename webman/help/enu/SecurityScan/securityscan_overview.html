<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>You can check current the status of DSM, scan the system, and check the scanning progress and result summary. Security Advisor scans DSM and your DiskStation by checking a number of security rules. The number and types of rules depend on how you configure your <strong>Security Baseline</strong>. Your <strong>Security Baseline</strong> is determined by your needs. Are you using your DiskStation for work and business or home and personal use? You will be asked to choose a <strong>Security Baseline</strong> the first time you start a scan. This can be changed later in the <strong>Advanced</strong> page.</p>
<h3>System status</h3>
