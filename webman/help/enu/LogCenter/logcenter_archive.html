<h2>Archive Settings</h2>

<p>The <strong>Archive Settings</strong> page provides options to configure how and where logs received by Log Center are archived. Use the options below to specify the storage location and rules to automatically create archives of logs.</p>


<h3>Storage destination for archives</h3>

<p>The destination refers to the folder where logs received by Log Center are stored and archived. Click <strong>Select location</strong> to choose the folder.</p>
<p>If you want the local logs of the DiskStation to be archived to the same destination, tick the box marked <strong>Archive local logs to the storage location specified above</strong>. In most cases, this provides more storage space for local logs, allowing you to maintain more complete system logs.</p>

To browse archived local logs, click <strong>Open log archive</strong> and select <strong>SYNOSYSLOGDB__LOCALARCH.DB</strong>.</p>
</div>
