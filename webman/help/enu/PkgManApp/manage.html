<h2>Manage Packages</h2>
<p>
After installing packages either online or manually, you can manage them in Package Center to keep them up-to-date and running smoothly. The instructions below will explain how to launch, update, uninstall, run or stop the packages, and troubleshoot package problems.
</p>

<h4>To update packages, do any of the following: </h4>
<p>
Always keeping your packages up-to-date is the best practice to maintain the health of your DiskStation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Click <strong>Update</strong> on the left panel to see available updates. Click the <strong>Update</strong> buttons or <strong>Update All</strong> to update packages. </li>
<li>
Click <b>Manual Install</b> to install a package by uploading <b>.spk</b> file (available at Synology's <a href="http://www.synology.com/support/download.php" target="_blank">Download Center</a> or third party websites).
</li>
<li>The package updates will appear according to the options at <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Auto Update</strong>. See <a href="configure.html">here</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="note_head">Note: </span>If you want to receive email or desktop notification when updates are available, click <b>Settings</b> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Notification</strong>, tick the checkboxes, and then click <b>OK</b>.
</p>

<h4>To repair packages, do either of the following:</h4>
<p>If errors occurred on a package of your&nbsp; DiskStation, you have to repair it to make it work again. Sometimes this happens because the package is 
too out-dated to be compatible with the latest version of DSM, and other times the program files of the package are missing or corrupted.&nbsp; Packages that need to be repaired will be listed under the <strong>Installed</strong> category. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Click the <strong>Repair</strong> buttons to repair packages.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Manual Install</b> to re-install and repair a package by uploading <b>.spk</b> file (available at Synology's <a href="http://www.synology.com/support/download.php" target="_blank">Download Center</a> or third party websites). </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="note_head">Note: </span>By clicking <strong>Repair</strong> you will actually install the latest version of this package, rather than repair the old 
one. Please contact the publisher or developer of this package if you still have 
trouble installing the package.</p>
<h4>To uninstall existing packages:</h4>
<p>
Click on an installed package and choose <b>Uninstall</b> from the <b>Action</b> drop-down menu to uninstall the package.</p>

<h4>To run or stop package services:</h4>
<p>
Click on an installed package and choose <b>Run</b> or <b>Stop</b> from the <b>Action</b> drop-down menu to run or stop the package.

	<li>Remove the package as well as its database (if any), and re-install it.</li>
	<li>Contact the publisher or developer of the package for help and support. </li>
</ul>

<h4>To find the contact information of a package publisher:</h4>

Please contact the publishers or developers of each application for feature requests, questions and other feedback. Some packages have a publisher in addition to a developer. The publisher builds and makes the package available for Synology products, while the essential functionalities of the package are provided by courtesy of the developer.&nbsp; If a publisher is provided, please find the publisher for support. </p>
