<h2>Volumes & Disk Groups</h2>

<p>Volumes and disk groups are the basic tools for managing and organizing the storage space on your DiskStation. In this article, we'll briefly describe the difference between the two.</p>

<h3>Volume</h3>
<p>Volumes provide the basic storage space on your DiskStation. All of your stuff -- such as shared folders, documents, and package data -- is stored on volumes. Therefore, before you start storing anything on your DiskStation, you'll need to create at least one volume.</p>

<h3>Disk Group</h3>
<p>Disk groups are composed of one or more hard drives combined into a single data partition. You can think of disk groups as the foundation on which one or more volumes or iSCSI LUN can be built. Disk groups provide greater flexibility, allowing you to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose from various RAID types, depending on the number of hard drives installed.</li>
<li>Create a single, large volume, or create several volumes with customizable storage capacity. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>A disk group can only be created on models with two or more bays with multiple hard drives installed.</p>
