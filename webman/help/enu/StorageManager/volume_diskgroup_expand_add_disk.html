<h2>Add a Hard Drive to Expand Storage Capacity</h2>

<p>If there are empty hard drive slots on your DiskStation, you can install additional hard drives and add them to an existing volume or disk group. This article provides instructions to expand an existing volume or disk group by installing additional hard drives.</p>

<h3>Before You Start</h3>

<p>Before starting, make sure the hard drives that you want to add meet the following size requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For SHR:</strong> The capacity of the hard drive you wish to add must be equal to or larger than the largest hard drive in the volume or disk group, or be equal to any of the hard drives in the volume or disk group. For example, if your SHR volume is composed of three hard drives – 2 TB, 1.5 TB, and 1 TB respectively – then the capacity of the new hard drive must be at least 2 TB or equal to 1.5 TB or 1 TB.</li>
  <li><strong>For RAID 5 and RAID 6:</strong> The capacity of the hard drive you wish to add must be equal to or larger than the smallest hard drive in the volume or disk group. For example, if your volume is composed of three hard drives – 2 TB, 1.5 TB, and 1 TB respectively – then the capacity of the new hard drive must be at least 1 TB.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h4>Check Volume Status</h4>

<p>Make sure the status of your volume or disk group is <strong>Normal</strong>. If not, you must first repair it.</p>
</div>


<h3>  Add a Hard Drive to a Volume or Disk Group</h3>

<ul>
<li>Synology Hybrid RAID (SHR)</li>
<li>JBOD</li>
<li>RAID 5</li>
