<h2>Sending Files as Email Attachments</h2>

<p>You can directly send files as email attachments in <strong>File Station </strong>by right-clicking selected files and then selecting <strong>Send as email attachments</strong>. An email window will appear with a few useful features:</p>
<ul>
<li>To: If you have synced any contacts for your email account, a contacts list will appear, displaying synced contacts associated with your email account.</li>
<li>From: You can select the default email account or another added email account. The contacts list will automatically switch to the selected email account.</li>
<li>Attachments: The selected attachments appear at the bottom of the email. You can add more attachments using the attachments button.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
  <h4>Note:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Only files can be added as attachments.</li>
    <li>You can attach up to 10 files in a single email.</li>
    <li>The maximum total file size of all attachments in a single email will depend on your email service. If you are not sure, we recommend limiting the total file size of all attachments to 25MB. </li>
