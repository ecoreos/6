<h1>Snapshot & Replication</h1>

<p>Snapshot & Replication is an expert of data backup and recovery. Businesses need data protection to prevent data loss from accidental 
deletion, application crashes, data corruption, and viruses.</p>

<p>The "<strong>snapshot</strong>" is a point-in-time copy stored in the same 
  volume used to record the whole data status at the time upon being taken. 
  Snapshots use only a small amount of additional storage space, and do not have a 
performance impact. </p>

<p>With the snapshots, if a user accidentally modifies or deletes data on a 
volume with snapshots, you are able to quickly restore the data back to the previous time at which the snapshot was taken. In addition, it allows users to recover their own deleted or modified files in 
shared folders without assistance from the administrator.</p>

<p>Snapshot & Replication helps you manage and monitor the snapshots on your DiskStation.</p>

<p>Depending on the functions supported by your DiskStation, <strong>Snapshot & Replication</strong> helps you accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take and manage snapshots of <strong>shared folders*</strong> and <strong>iSCSI LUNs</strong>.</li>
	<li>Configure <strong>scheduled snapshots</strong> and <strong>retention settings</strong>. These settings will determine when and how the snapshots should be taken, retained, and/or removed.</li>
	<li>View the logs of snapshot-related events.</li>
</ul>

<p>_____<br/>
<strong>*</strong> Snapshots of shared folders can only be taken when your storage is using the <strong>Btrfs</strong> file system.</p>
