<h2> Monitor</h2>

<p>This page contains three tabs which display the monitor of system status, service, and network interface. This page allows you to monitor certain targets. If a monitored target fails on the active server, the system will failover to the standby, passive server (as long as the passive server is operating normally). The following tabs appear on this page:</p>

<h3> System Status Tab</h3>
<p>The system status is monitored by default, and cannot be disabled. Failover will be triggered when system failures occur in the active server. The following sections appear on this tab:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Activer server status:</b> Failover upon the failure of the active server to provide services. For example, both power units of the active server fail.</li>
  <li><b>Storage connectivity:</b> Failover upon the situation in which a drive is absent on the active server but present on the passive server.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Service Tab</h3>
<p>Displays services that can be monitored and their status. Failover will be triggered when services are abnormal. The following sections appear on this tab:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Service: </b> Displays services that can be monitored.</li>
  <li><b>Status: </b> Displays whether services are running or not.</li>
  <li><b>Monitor: </b>Tick the checkbox next to a service to start monitoring it. The system will failover if the selected service fails.</li>
</ul>

<h4>To monitor a service:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Find the service that you wish to monitor. Make sure the service status is normal.</li>
<li>Tick the checkbox next to it.</li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to save settings.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Services that can be monitored are as follows: Windows File Service, iSCSI Target, FTP, Mac File Service, NFS Service.</p>
</div>

<h3> Network Interface Tab</h3>
<p>Displays all logical network interfaces that can be monitored. Failover will be triggered if network connection is abnormal. (Refer to Notes as follows.) The following sections appear on this tab:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Network Interface: </b> Displays the interfaces that can be monitored.</li>
  <li><b>Monitor: </b>Tick the checkbox next to an interface to start monitoring it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>If <strong>Monitor</strong> checkbox is ticked, the system will failover to the passive server when the network connection of active server fails or malfunctions, and the network connection of the passive server is still functioning normally.</p>
<ul>
<li>Failover will be triggered only if the passive server has more healthy connections. For example, if the active server has three connections and one fails, the system will trigger a failover only if the passive server has three or more healthy connections.</li>
<li>Connections combined with Link Aggregation count as one connection. For example, if two connections are combined, and one of them fails, but the other one is still working, the connection will still count as healthy.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>To monitor an interface:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Find the interface that you wish to monitor. Make sure the cables have been connected correctly to the interfaces on both the active and passive servers.</li>
<li> Tick the checkbox next to it.</li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to save settings.</li>
</ol>
