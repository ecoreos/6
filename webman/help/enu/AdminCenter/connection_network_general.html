<h2>General</h2>

<p>Generic network options such as default gateway, DNS server, proxy and IPv6 tunneling are available at <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Network</strong> > <strong>General</strong>.</p>


<h3>Renaming DiskStation Device</h3>
<p>To rename your DiskStation device, enter the new server name and click <b>Apply</b>.</p>
<p>The server name is case insensitive and can be in the range of 1 to 15 characters, consisting of letters, numbers, underscores and minus signs. The first character of the name must be a letter.</p>


<h3>Specifying Default Gateway</h3>
<p>Simply enter the IP address for the default gateway and click <b>Apply</b> to save the setting.</p>


<h3>Specifying DNS Server IP Address</h3>
<p>You can choose to manually configure the IP address of your DNS server. In this case, the IP address of your preferred DNS server must be entered. An alternate DNS server IP address can also be entered, providing backup if the preferred DNS server experiences problems. Once the DNS server IP addresses have been configured as desired, please click <strong>Apply</strong> to save your settings.</p>


<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>The DNS server and Default gateway fields will be set automatically and cannot be changed when all your network interfaces are configured automatically or when you are using PPPoE connection.</p>
</div>



<h3><a name="proxy"></a>Connecting via Proxy Server</h3>
<p>To allow your DiskStation device to connect via a proxy server, tick <b>Connect via a proxy server</b>, enter the <b>Address</b> and <b>Port</b>, and then click <b>Apply</b>.</p>


<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> to configure HTTP proxy, HTTPS proxy and authentication information.
<li>By default, the HTTPS proxy settings are the same as HTTP proxy.</li>
<li>If <b>Connect via a proxy server</b> is ticked, DSM Update and Package Center along with some other packages will always connect to the Internet through proxy.</li>
<li>If <b>Bypass proxy server for local addresses</b> is ticked, please make sure the DNS server used by the DiskStation can resolve queries for devices in the local network.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3>Enabling IPv6 Tunneling</h3>
<p>Until IPv6 completely supplants IPv4, IPv6 tunneling is needed to enable hosts with IPv6 addresses to reach IPv4 services. This technique provides a way to carry IPv6 traffic within existing IPv4 networks.<br>
If you are not sure how to configure IPv6 or face any connection problems, please contact your Internet Service Provider.</p>
<h4>To enable IPv6 Tunnel:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Tick the <b>Enable tunnel</b> checkbox to enable tunnel support.</li>

<li>In <b>Server address</b>, enter the hostname or the IP address of the tunnel service provider, for example: anonymous.freenet6.net.</li>

<li>Select if you want to <b>Connect anonymously</b> or <b>Connect with an existing account</b>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Your external IPv6 address may be automatically updated by the service provider. However, DiskStation device will not remove the old IPv6 address immediately.</p>
