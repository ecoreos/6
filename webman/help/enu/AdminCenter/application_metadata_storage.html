<h1>Multimedia Database</h1>
<p>
DiskStation uses a multimedia database to keep track of multimedia files and log entries stored on the media source (shared folders created on your external storage devices, such as <b>usbshare1</b>).</p>
<p>
<span class="note_head">Important: </span>If you want DSM's multimedia services (such as <b>Media Server</b>, <b>iTunes</b>, <b>Audio Station</b>, and <b>Download Station</b>) to access multimedia files stored on the external storage devices connected to the USB port of your DiskStation, or if you want to enable DSM's log services and see the log records at <b>Main Menu</b> > <b>System Information</b> > <a href="../SystemInfoApp/log.html">Log</a>, the multimedia database has to be enabled first. Otherwise, all related services will be deactivated.
</p>
<h4>To enable the multimedia database:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Tick <b>Enable multimedia database</b>.
</li>
<li>
Do any of the following:
<ul>
<li>
Choose <b>Automatic configuration</b> if you want to have DSM automatically select a shared folder for storing the multimedia database. If the external storage device which contains the shared folder is removed, DSM will automatically select any other shared folder for storing the database.
</li>
<li>
Choose <b>Please select a shared folder to store your database</b>, and then choose from the drop-down menu to manually select a shared folder for storing the database.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<span class="note_head">Warning: </span>To prevent the database from being corrupted, make sure you have ejected its storage device at <b>Main Menu</b> > <b>Control Panel</b> > <a href="system_externaldevice_devicelist.html">External Devices</a> before removing it from DiskStation.
</p>
<h4>To include or exclude shared folders from the multimedia source:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Click <b>Multimedia Source</b>.
</li>
<li>
Tick or uncheck the checkboxes next to the shared folder(s) to make your selection.
</li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Multimedia files and log records in the selected shared folders will be indexed, and the indexed information will be added to the multimedia database.
</p>
<h4>To refresh the multimedia database:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Click <b>Refresh Database</b>. All data in the multimedia database will be replaced by re-indexed information about the current multimedia source.
</li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<span class="note_head">Note: </span>If a large portion of data in the multimedia database is no longer used (for example, you disconnect a USB disk which will never be used with DiskStation again, resulting in redundant indexed information in the database), refreshing the multimedia database can help you clear all unused data or downsize the database. However, doing so requires repetitive disk reading and writing, which might consume system resources and result in shortened disk lifespan. Please use this function with discretion.
