<h4>To set up a wireless network:</h4>
<p>
Go to the <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> tab. Click <b>Set up a wireless network</b> and choose from the following options (If you are already connected to a wireless network, click <b>Disconnect</b> first).
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Join a wireless network</b>: The wizard will scan available wireless access points or Ad-Hoc networks with their signal strength and security status. If the access point you want to access is locked with password protection, the wizard will ask you to enter the password.</li>
<li><b>Connect to a hidden wireless network</b>: If an access point doesn't broadcast its SSID (Network Name) for privacy reason, it will not be discovered during the scanning. You can manually connect to those hidden access points by entering the required information manually.</li>
<li><b>Create an Ad-Hoc Network</b>: In addition to infrastructure network, in which a central access point (AP) bridges the wireless network to a wired Ethernet network, ad-Hoc network is also widely used. In a ad-Hoc network, all wireless devices within range of each other can communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion without a central access point. To set up an ad-hoc network, all wireless devices have to be configured for ad-hoc mode instead of the infrastructure mode.</li>
</ul>
