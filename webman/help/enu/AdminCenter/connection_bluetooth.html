<li>When playing music through Bluetooth speakers or headphones, you might experience playback issues if the settings of your Bluetooth adapter are modified or you connect with too many Bluetooth devices at the same time.</li>
<li>Depending on the device, if a pair of Bluetooth speakers which have been connected to your DiskStation are later connected to another DiskStation (or Bluetooth music player), the speakers might forget your DiskStation. In this case, an error will occur when attempting to play music with the speakers. To solve this problem, please remove the speakers and try connecting to them again.</li>
