<h2>Conversion Settings</h2>
<p>When you upload photos or videos for use with Media Server or Photo Station, thumbnails will be created for better browsing experience. You can set the thumbnail quality and monitor the conversion progress.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you would like to view videos in the <strong>photo</strong> shared folder of Photo Station on your mobile devices, you can enable video conversion and view the conversion progress as well.</p>

</li>
<li>
Click <b>Apply</b>.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section">
<span class="note_head">Note: </span>

</ul>
</div>
<h4>To enable video conversion for mobile devices:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Tick <strong>Enable video conversion for mobile devices</strong>.</li>

</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Only the videos uploaded to the <strong>photo</strong> shared folder of Photo Station can be converted into the format supported by mobile devices.</li>

</ul>
<li>
When the conversion process is complete, the icon at the taskbar will disappear.
</li>
</ol>
