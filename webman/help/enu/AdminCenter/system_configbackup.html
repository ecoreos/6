<h2>Configuration Backup</h2>
<p>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Update & Restore</strong> to immediately back up system configurations to a local computer. This allows you to save various settings (e.g. users, groups, file service settings, etc.) and restore the settings at a later date. System configurations are saved as a .dss format file.</p>

<h4>To back up system configurations:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Back up configuration</b>. </li>
<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

</ol>

<h4>To restore system configurations:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Restore configuration</b>.</li>
<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

<li>Check the corresponding checkboxes of configurations you want to restore and then click <strong>OK</strong>. You may also check the <strong>Overwrite conflicting settings</strong> option to overwrite the current settings for any selection of existing users, groups,  shared folders, and services.</li>
<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>
<li>A warning prompt appears. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to continue.</li>
