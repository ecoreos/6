<h1>Shared Folder</h1>
<p>Shared folders are the basic directories where you can store files and folders on your DiskStation. Before storing any files on your DiskStation, you need to create at least one shared folder. Data stored in shared folders can be kept private or shared with specific users or user groups according to customizable access permissions. In addition, shared folders can be encrypted during creation, adding an additional layer of protection.</p>
