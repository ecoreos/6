<h4>To edit the speed limit of the group:</h4>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b> to finish.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Speed Limit for Users Belonging to Multiple Groups</h4>

<p>When a user belongs to multiple groups, his speed limit is decided based on the group with the highest available bandwidth at the time of transferring files. Because bandwidth is divided evenly among users currently transferring files, the available bandwidth changes based on how many users are currently consuming the group's shared bandwidth.</p>

<p>For example, one user "John" belongs to &quot;Group 1&quot; (speed limit 500KB/s; total five users) and &quot;Group 2&quot; (speed limit 400KB/s; total two users).</p>
<ul>
<li>If the users of Group 1 and Group 2 are all transferring files at the same time, then John's speed limit will become 200KB/s, and his consumption will count against the shared bandwidth quota of Group 2.</li>
<li>When the other users of Group 1 have finished transferring files, then John's speed limit will immediately change to 500KB/s, and his consumption will count against the shared bandwidth quota of Group 1.</li>
</ul>
