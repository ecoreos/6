<h2>Edit Encrypted Folder</h2>
<p>After the folder is encrypted, you can use the <b>Encryption</b> drop-down menu to edit the folder.</p>
<h4>The items shown in the menu depend on the status of the selected shared folder:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you select an unencrypted shared folder, the <b>Encryption</b> drop-down menu is disabled.</li>
<li>If you select an encrypted shared folder which is mounted, you can choose <b>Unmount</b> from the <b>Encryption</b> drop-down menu to unmount the folder, or <b>Export key</b> to save the encryption key.</li>
<li>If you select an encrypted shared folder which is unmounted, you can choose <b>Mount</b> from <b>Encryption</b> drop-down menu, and then enter or import the encryption key to mount the folder for access.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<span class="note_head">Note:</span>
<li><span  class="note_content">It is very important to remember the encryption key.</span> It is strongly recommended that you export and save the encryption key. If you forget or lose the key, there is no way to rescue the encrypted data.</li>
<li>When the encrypted shared folder is mounted, you cannot rename it or change its volume location. You can only make changes after unmounting it.</li></ol>
