<h2>Domain/LDAP Users or Groups</h2>
<p>If your DiskStation is joined to a directory service as a Windows Domain or LDAP client, you can set up and modify domain/LDAP users' or groups' access permission to DiskStation shared folders and DSM applications, and enable the home service for all domain/LDAP users.</p>
<h3>Domain/LDAP User</h3>
<p class="disable-dockerx64">Depending on the type of directory service you are joining, click the <strong>Domain users</strong> or <strong>LDAP User</strong> tab to set up the shared folder and application permissions and the quota of disk capacity of each user.</p>
<p class="enable-dockerx64">Depending on the type of directory service you are joining, click the <strong>Domain users</strong> or <strong>LDAP User</strong> tab to set up the shared folder and application permissions of each user.</p>
<h4>The rules of privilege settings include the following:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the event of privilege conflicts, the privilege priority will be: NA > RW > RO.</li>
<li>Privilege preview: Userâ€™s privilege would be shown here, and that is decided based on the privileges setting of the user and the groups joined by the user.</li>
<li>Group privileges: Assign privileges to groups access to access shared folders.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Home</h3>
<p>Like local users, all domain/LDAP users can access their own <b>home</b> folder via CIFS, AFP, FTP, or File Station. </p>
<p>
Users with administrative privileges can access all personal folders located in the <b>homes</b> shared folder. All users' home folders are located in one of the sub-folders under a folder named "<b>@DH-domain name</b>" (for domain users) or "<b>@LH-FQDN name</b>" (for LDAP users). The name of the user's home folder is the user account plus an unique number.</p>
<ol>
<span class="note_head">Note: </span>
<li>To delete the <span class="bold_general">homes</span> shared folder, user home service must be disabled first.</li>
<li>Enabling the home service for domain/LDAP users will also enable the home service for local users if it's not enabled yet.
</li>
</ol> 
<h3>Domain/LDAP Group</h3> 
<p>Depending on the type of directory service you are joining, click the <b>Domain group</b> or <b>LDAP Group</b> tab to configure domain/LDAP groups' access privileges to shared folders. The priority of privileges is: NA > RW > RO.</p>
