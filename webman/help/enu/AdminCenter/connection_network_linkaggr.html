<h2><a name="link_aggr"></a>Link Aggregation*</h2>
<p>DiskStation supports multi-LAN, allowing you to combine those LAN interfaces using the Link Aggregation technology. Link Aggregation increases the bandwidth of your DiskStation by aggregating multiple network interfaces and provides traffic failover to maintain network connection in case the connection is down.</p>
<p>After your LAN interfaces are combined, you will see a new interface named <b>Bond</b> at <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Network</b> > <b>Network Interface</b>, which could be configured as you would with other interfaces (such as LAN or PPPoE).</p>


<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>With Link Aggregation enabled, the network traffic will automatically get adjusted and balanced for each connected device.</li>
<li>If the network interfaces are connected to multiple switches, make sure the switch ports are in the same LAN or VLAN.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h4>To combine multiple LANs with Link Aggregation:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Network</strong> > <strong>Network Interface</strong>. Click <strong>Create</strong> > <strong>Create Bond</strong>.</li>

<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>


<li>Select the mode you want.

<div class="section">
<h4>Mode descriptions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adaptive Load Balancing</strong>: This mode optimizes the network traffic received and sent by your DiskStation  whether or not the switch supports Link Aggregation.
    To avoid unexpected errors, please do not enable Link Aggregation on the switch even when it is supported.</li>
  <li><strong>IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic Link Aggregation</strong>: This mode optimizes the  network traffic received and sent by your DiskStation, and requires IEEE 802.3ad (Dynamic) Link Aggregation (LACP, 802.1AX) to be enabled on the switch(es). If multiple switches are used, these switches have to be stackable and properly configured.</li>
<li><strong>Balance XOR</strong>: This mode balances the  network traffic received and sent by your DiskStation, and requires Static Link Aggregation to be enabled on the switch(es). If multiple switches are used, these switches have to be stackable and properly configured. If Link Aggregation is not supported by the switch, the traffic sent by your DiskStation can still be balanced. With this mode, the lost links can be detected but not the cause (e.g., when the Ethernet cables are unplugged or the switch is misconfigured).</li>
<li><strong>Active/Standby</strong>: This mode provides your DiskStation with network fault tolerance. That is, when the active network interface goes down, one of the other LAN ports will take over to maintain the network connection. You can choose this mode without configuring the switch or with a switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li>Select the interfaces to create Link Aggregation.</li>

<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

<li>Configure the IP settings. You can also enable VLAN if necessary. Click <b>Apply</b> to complete the setup.</li>

<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

<li>Once finished, you can see the new interface named <b>Bond 1</b> in the <b>Network Interface</b> list.</li>

<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

</ol>

<h4>To edit the Link Aggregation settings:</h4>
<ol>
<li>To change the Link Aggregation mode or view the information of the physical devices, go to <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Network</b> > <b>Network Interface</b>.</li>
<li>Select the interface <b>Bond 1</b>, and click the <b>Edit</b> button.</li>

<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

<li>Go to corresponding tabs to modify the desired settings.</li>
</ol>

<h4>To remove Link Aggregation:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Network</b> > <b>Network Interface</b>.</li>
<li>Select the interface <b>Bond 1</b> and click the <b>Delete</b> button.</li>

<img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

<li>Once finished, you will see that <b>Bond 1</b> is now replaced by two LAN interfaces.</li>
