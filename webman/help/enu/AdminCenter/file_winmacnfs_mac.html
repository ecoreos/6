<h2>Mac File Service</h2>

<p>
At <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>File Services</strong> > <strong>Win/Mac/NFS</strong>, you can enable Mac file service to make DiskStation a Mac file server (AFP server).</p>

<h4>To enable Mac file service:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Tick <b>Enable Mac file service</b> to make DiskStation a Mac file server (AFP server).
</li>
<li>
Set a <b>Time Machine</b> backup folder if necessary. (See the section below for more information.)
</li>

<li>
Click <b>Apply</b>.
</li>

</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>To back up data from Time Machine to DiskStation, select a shared folder from the drop-down menu. </li>
<li> Shared folders that are being used by other services will not be available for Time Machine.</li>
</ul>

</div>



<h3>Enabling Transfer Logging</h3>
<p>Checking this option enables logging of file access operations, including creating, deleting, reading, writing, moving, and renaming files or folders via AFP, also known as Apple Filing Protocol.</p>


<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
<h4>Apply default UNIX permissions:</h4>
<p>Enabling this option applies the default UNIX permissions when uploading or creating files and folders. Applied permissions are the same as permissions applied by the UNIX command <strong>umask</strong>. When this option is enabled, UNIX permissions are 644 for files and 755 for folders. When this option is disabled, UNIX permissions are 666 for files and 777 for folders. The default umask value is 022.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Enabling this option might cause inconsistent permission issues between different protocols. To avoid inconsistencies, we suggest leaving this option disabled.</p>
</div>

<h4>Immediately release resources after disconnect:</h4>
<p>Enabling this option immediately releases resources when the AFP server connection unexpectedly disconnects. If you receive "Volume in use" error messages while using Time Machine, please enable this option.</p>
<h4>To enable Bonjour printer broadcast:</h4>
<p>Tick <b>Enable Bonjour Printer Broadcast</b> to allow Mac clients to browse and locate the printer connected to DiskStation .</p>

<h4 class="disable-hi3535">To search file contents via Spotlight on Finder:</h4>
<p class="disable-hi3535">After folders are fully indexed and then mounted on your Mac computer, you can use Spotlight on Finder to search for the contained files and their contents.</p>
<ol class="disable-hi3535">
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Indexing Service</strong> > <strong>File Indexing</strong> > <strong>Indexed Folder List</strong> > <strong>Create</strong> to index specific folders and contained files by filetype.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to perform indexing.</li>
<li>Mount the indexed folders to your Mac computer.</li>
<li>On your Mac computer, click the desired mounted folder on the left panel of Finder, and use Spotlight on Finder to search for the contained files.</li>

</ol>

<div class="section disable-hi3535">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>To search within mounted folders, use Spotlight on Finder. Spotlight on the Mac desktop only allows searching for local files.</li>
<li>On Mac OS X 10.9 and later versions, Spotlight on Finder supports searching within mounted folders by tag name and category.</li>
</ul>
