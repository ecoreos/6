<h2>Create a Shared Folder</h2>
<p>Shared folders are the basic directories where you can store and manage files and folders on your DiskStation. Before storing any files, you'll need to create at least one shared folder in DSM. </p>

<h4>To create a shared folder:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Shared Folder</strong> and click <strong>Create</strong>.<br /><img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/></li>
	<li>Specify a name and description for the shared folder.<br /><img src="about:blank" class="help_image disable-bromolow disable-grantley disable-avoton disable-braswell disable-broadwell disable-kvmx64"/><img src="../../../online_img/dsm/AdminCenter/file_share_create/howto571-5.png" class="help_image enable-bromolow enable-grantley enable-avoton enable-braswell enable-broadwell enable-kvmx64"/></li>
	<li>Select a storage on which to create the shared folder (skip this step if only one storage exists).<br /><img src="about:blank" class="help_image disable-bromolow disable-grantley disable-avoton disable-braswell disable-broadwell disable-kvmx64"/><img src="../../../online_img/dsm/AdminCenter/file_share_create/howto571-6.png" class="help_image enable-bromolow enable-grantley enable-avoton enable-braswell enable-broadwell enable-kvmx64"/></li>
	<li>Modify the following options if necessary:<br /><img src="about:blank" class="help_image disable-bromolow disable-grantley disable-avoton disable-braswell disable-broadwell disable-kvmx64"/><img src="../../../online_img/dsm/AdminCenter/file_share_create/howto571-7.png" class="help_image enable-bromolow enable-grantley enable-avoton enable-braswell enable-broadwell enable-kvmx64"/>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Hide this shared folder in "My Network Places":</strong> Keeps the shared folder from appearing under "Network" in Windows File Explorer. This option does not affect the access privileges of the shared folder.
				<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
				<p>Hiding a shared folder in &quot;My Network Places&quot; does not affect its access right. The access right of the hidden shared folder will remain unchanged. Users who have the proper access rights to the shared folder can still access it by entering &quot;\\server name\shared folder name&quot;.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Hide sub-folders and files from users without permissions:</strong> When <strong>Hide sub-folders and files from users without permissions</strong> is enabled, if a user without read privileges attempts to access a shared folder via Windows File Sharing protocol, the user will not be able to view sub-folders or files within the shared folder. This prevents users from being confused when they connect to their Synology products, but encounter a large number of files and sub-folders that they cannot open.
				<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>This feature is only supported with Windows File Sharing protocol.</li>
					<li>You can modify privilege settings of each folder and file in File Station by right-clicking on it. Choose <strong>Properties</strong> from the drop-down menu and click on the <strong>Permission</strong> tab.</li>
					<li>The shared folder itself will not be hidden from users without   permissions by enabling <strong>Hide sub-folders and files from users without permissions</strong>. Only the sub-folders and files   within this shared folder will be hidden.</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Enable Recycle Bin:</strong> When files in the shared folder are deleted, they will be moved to a folder named <strong>#recycle</strong>. Access to the recycle bin can be limited to users belonging to the <strong>administrators</strong> group.</li>
	<a name="sharequota"></a><li class="enable-bromolow enable-grantley enable-avoton enable-braswell enable-broadwell enable-kvmx64"><strong>Enable shared folder quota:</strong> To specify the maximum capacity for each shared folder, tick <strong>Enable shared folder quota</strong> checkbox, and enter the maximum capacity (e.g. 10 GB) in the following field.
		<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Only when the storage is using Btrfs file system will the option of <strong>Enable shared folder quota</strong> be available for shared folders.</li>
			<li>The combined storage usage of all users' <strong>home</strong> directories cannot exceed the quota of "<strong>homes</strong>".</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
	</li>
	<a name="integrity_protection"></a><li class="enable-bromolow enable-grantley enable-avoton enable-braswell enable-broadwell enable-kvmx64"><strong>Enable advanced data integrity protection:</strong> To protect a shared folder with <strong>CRC32 checksum</strong> and <strong>copy-on-write</strong> strategies, you can <strong>enable advanced data integrity protection</strong> during the shared folder's creation. CRC32 checksum is applied to checking if the data remain identical to when they were originally written, and will notify the user once any corruption has been detected. Copy-on-write helps to improve data consistency upon abnormal system shutdown.
		<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>This option is available for only the volumes using the Btrfs file system.</li>
			<li>You can enable/disable this option for each shared folder during its creation. This option cannot be modified once the shared folder has been created.</li>
			<li>If files such as databases are constantly edited and updated, the amount of fragmented files might increase due to copy-on-write. It is recommended you disable this option to enhance the performance.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
	</li>
    <a name="btrfs_compression"></a><li class="enable-bromolow enable-grantley enable-avoton enable-braswell enable-broadwell enable-kvmx64"><strong>Enable file compression</strong>: Data in the created shared folder will be automatically compressed by the Btrf file system to save the storage space. When retrieved for use, the data will be automatically decompressed.
		<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>This option is available only when you create a shared folder in a Btrfs volume or when <strong>Advanced data integrity protection</strong> is enabled.</li>
			<li>This option cannot be modified once the shared folder is created.</li>
			<li>The compression rate differs with data types: Text files enjoy the highest compression rate, while multimedia files (e.g. images, music or videos) may not be well compressed since they are already compressed for output.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Encrypt this shared folder:</strong> If you would like to encrypt the shared folder, do the following:
		<ol>
			<li>Specify and confirm a new encryption key. The encryption key cannot include commas (,) or equal signs (=). </li>
			<li>If necessary, tick the box <strong>Mount automatically on startup</strong> to mount the encrypted folder automatically when the system starts. If this option is disabled, the encrypted shared folder will be unmounted next time the DiskStation restarts. To view or access an unmounted shared folder, you will need to mount the folder manually by importing or entering the encryption key.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to finish.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h4>Shared Folder Naming Rules:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Shared folder names are case insensitive and can include 1-32 characters. Names cannot include the following characters: <strong>! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , / : ; <= > ? @ [ ] \ ^ ` { } | ~</strong></li>
	<li>The following names are reserved for system use: <strong>.</strong>, <strong>..</strong>, <strong>global</strong>, <strong>home</strong>, <strong>homes</strong>, <strong>printers</strong>, <strong>public</strong>, <strong>satashare</strong>, <strong>surveillance</strong>, <strong>usbbackup</strong>, <strong>usbshare</strong>. </li>
	<li>The first character of a shared folder name cannot be a minus sign or a space, and the last character cannot be a space character.</li>
	<li>The shared folder <strong>description</strong> is case sensitive and limited up to 64 displayable Unicode characters.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="section"><h4>Encrypting Shared Folders:</h4>
<p>AES 256-bit encryption protects data by blocking off all unauthorized access attempts. Once a shared folder is encrypted, those without the encryption key will not be able to access or modify the encrypted data even if they remove the hard drives from your DiskStation and mount them on another device.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Shared folders can only be encrypted at the time of creation. </li>
	<li>The names of files and folders within encrypted shared folders cannot exceed 143 English characters or 43 Asian characters.</li>
	<li>Encrypted shared folders cannot be accessed via NFS.</li>
	<li>If passwords are restored to default using the reset button located on the DiskStation, encrypted shared folders will be unmounted, and the option to automatically mount encrypted shared folders will be disabled.</li>
	<li class="enable-dockerx64">Encrypted shared folders are only supported in high privilege mode. To use this feature, go to the Docker package on your host DSM, select the <strong>Docker DSM</strong> you want to enable encrypted shared folders for, click <strong>Edit</strong> and tick the box next to <strong>Execute container using high privileges</strong>.</li>
</ul>
