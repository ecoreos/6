<h2>Auto Block</h2>

<p>The auto block feature helps improve the security of your DiskStation by blocking the IP addresses of clients with too many failed login attempts. This helps reduce the risk of accounts being broken into using brute-force attacks.</p>

<p>You can also create and manage an allow list to add IP addresses that you trust, or a block list to always prevent certain IP addresses from logging in.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Various services and packages support auto block, such as the following: DSM, SSH, Telnet, rsync, network backup, shared folder sync, FTP, WebDAV, File Station, Photo Station, Audio Station, Video Station, Download Station, Mail Server, Mail Station, Time Backup, VPN Server, Cloud Station, and Synology mobile apps.</p>

<li>Tick <b>Enable auto block</b>.</li>

<li>Enter a number of failed login attempts in the <b>Login attempts</b> field and a number of minutes in the <b>Within (minutes)</b> field. An IP address shall be blocked when it exceeds the number of failed login attempts within the specified number of minutes.</li>
<li>Tick <b>Enable block expiration</b> and enter a number to remove a blocked IP address after the specified number of days.</li>
