<h3>Enabling Speed Limit</h3>
<p>Enable a speed limit to control the maximum usable bandwidth for users and groups who transfer data via FTP.</p>


<h4>To enable speed limit:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Tick the box marked <b>Enable speed limit</b>, or <strong>Enable speed limit according to a schedule</strong> if you would like to implement a speed limit at specific times only. This is a server-wide setting and will override the settings of individual users and groups. Choosing <strong>No speed limit</strong> disables the speed limit settings of all users and groups.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Speed Limit Settings</strong> to modify the settings for individual users or groups. For each user and group, you can select one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apply Group Settings:</strong> The speed limit settings will be the same as the group to which the user belongs. </li>
      <li class="disable-eds14"><strong>None:</strong> No speed limit will be applied when group members transfer files with the service.</li>
      <li><strong>Constant:</strong> A fixed, constant speed limit will be applied to the user or group members. Upload and download speed limits can be specified in the fields to the left.</li>
      <li><strong>Customized:</strong> Two different speed limits can be specified and applied to the user or group members according to a schedule. Click the <strong>Customize</strong> button to modify the speed limit settings and set a schedule.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <b>Apply</b>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Note:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>For more details regarding group speed limit dynamics, please see <a href="file_group_edit.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>When setting speed limit for a user, the <strong>Result</strong> section displays the user's actual speed limit according to his individual and group settings. For example, if a user "Achilles" has an individual download limit of 100 KB/s, but belongs to a user group with a download limit of 500 KB/s, then the <strong>Results</strong> section will display "0/500."</li>
