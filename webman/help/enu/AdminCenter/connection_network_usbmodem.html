<p>When equipped with a mobile broadband dongle, the DiskStation can connect to the Internet via a wireless, 3G/LTE network. The settings at <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Network</strong> > <strong>Network Interface</strong> > <strong>Mobile</strong> will help you establish and modify a wireless Internet connection via your mobile broadband dongle.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>For a complete list of mobile broadband dongles supported by Synology products, please visit <a href="http://www.synology.com/" target=_blank>www.synology.com</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>To set up a mobile network:</h4>
<p>When a mobile broadband dongle is connected to one of the USB ports on your DiskStation, the DiskStation will try to connect automatically. If a connection cannot be established automatically or you would like to modify connection settings, please see the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>SIM Unlock/Settings:</b> If the SIM card is PIN protected, it must be unlocked to allow the DiskStation to connect to the network. Once unlocked, this section provides options to modify PIN settings.</li>

<li><b>Edit:</b> You can manually configure the connection or choose according to location and carrier. Manually setting up the connection requires entering your APN, phone number, username, and password. If you do not know this information, please contact your mobile carrier for support.</li>

<li><b>Connect/Disconnect:</b> These buttons allow you to connect or disconnect the DiskStation from the 3G/LTE network.</li>
<li><b>Options:</b> This section includes an option to set the mobile broadband dongle interface as the default gateway for your DiskStation. When you configure the mobile network as the default gateway, Internet traffic from your DiskStation will go through the mobile network instead of the wired network. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>

<li>When connected to the Internet, some mobile broadband dongles will not display the signal strength if they do not support this feature.</li>
<li>For some mobile broadband dongles, you cannot change the SIM settings when they are connected to the Internet.</li>
