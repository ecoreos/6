<h1>Connect to VPN</h1>
<p>You can easily turn your DiskStation into a VPN client and connect to an existing VPN (Virtual Private Network) server via PPTP, OpenVPN, or L2TP/IPSec protocols. If you have multiple VPN servers, you can also create specific VPN profiles for each server to quickly switch and connect to different VPN servers with a simple click.</p>


<div class="section">
<h4>What is VPN?</h4>
<p>A VPN, or virtual private network, is a solution to meet the need to securely access resources on your private network from the Internet. For businesses or some individuals, with the need for expanding networking capabilities growing, the cost of this physical networking system and their technical support will increase exponentially. When considering the cost-efficiency and the long-term maintenances, VPN is a smart and increasingly attractive solution. With encryption and other security mechanisms, VPN technology allows business members to easily access the central network of the company and leveraging the resources in it just as in LAN. Individuals can also access resources on their home LAN when being far away from home.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li> DiskStation can only connect to OpenVPN servers which support tun-style tunnels on Layer 3.</li>
<li>Before installing the VPN package, make sure you have a VPN server to connect to. For better compatibility, you are suggested to connect to VPN services hosted on a DiskStation running the <strong>VPN Server</strong> package. To set up another DiskStation as a VPN server, please see <b>DSM Help</b> > <b>VPN Server</b> > <b>Set up VPN Server</b> for instructions.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h4>To create VPN profiles:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Network</b>.</li>

  <img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>
  
<li>Under the <b>Network Interface</b> tab, click <b>Create</b> and choose <b>Create VPN profile</b>.</li>

  <img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>
  
<li>When creating a new VPN profile, you can choose one of the following connection types:
	<ul>
		<li><b>PPTP</b>: PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) is a commonly used VPN solution supported by most clients (including Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices).</li>
		<li><b>OpenVPN</b>: OpenVPN is an open source solution for implementing VPN service. It protects the VPN connection with the SSL/TLS encryption mechanism.</li>
		<li><b>L2TP/IPSec</b>: L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) over IPSec provides virtual private networks with increased security and is supported by most clients (such as Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices).</li>
	</ul>
</li>

  <img src="about:blank" class="help_image"/>

<li>Refer to the sections below for instructions to set up any of the three type of VPN connections.</li>
