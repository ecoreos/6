<h2> Service Monitor</h2>

<p>This page allows you to monitor certain services. If a  monitored service fails on the active server, the system will failover to the standby, passive server (as long as the passive server is operating normally). The following sections appear on this page:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Service:</b> Displays services that can be monitored.</li>
  <li><b>Status: </b> Displays whether services are running or not.</li>
  <li><b>Failover when service fails: </b>Tick the checkbox next to a service to start monitoring it. The system will failover if the selected service fails.</li>
</ul>

<h4>To monitor a service:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Find the service that you wish to monitor. Tick the checkbox next to it.</li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to save settings.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Supported Services</h4>
<p>Services that can be monitored are as follows: Windows File Service, iSCSI Target, FTP, Mac File Service, NFS Service.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4>Failover When Network Connection Fails</h4>
<p>If this option is enabled, the system will failover to the passive server when the network connection of active server fails or malfunctions, and the network connection of the passive server is still functioning normally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Failover will be triggered only if the passive server has more healthy connections. For example, if the active server has three connections and one fails, the system will trigger a failover only if the passive server has three or more healthy connections.</li>
<li>Connections combined with Link Aggregation count as one connection. For example, if two connections are combined, and one of them fails, but the other one is still working, the connection will still count as healthy.</li>
</ul>
