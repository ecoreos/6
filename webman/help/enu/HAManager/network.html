 <h2>Network Settings</h2>
	<p>This page contains three tabs which display the network settings of the high-availability cluster, the active member server, and the passive member server.</p>
  
	<h3>HA Cluster Tab</h3>
	<p>When creating a high-availability cluster, the system generates a common IP address for the high-availability cluster IP to receive incoming connections. Additional high-availability cluster IP addresses can be created if necessary. The IP addresses of activated network interfaces on the active server will be displayed on this tab (the network interface used by the Heartbeat connection will not be displayed on this page, as said interface will be used for data replication between the two servers). This tab shows the below information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Network Interface:</b> The activated network interface(s) on the  active server.</li>
			<li><b>Connection:</b> Displays whether this interface is connected or not.</li>
			<li><b>IP address:</b> When creating a high-availability cluster, the system generates a common IP address for the high-availability cluster IP to receive incoming connections. You can connect to the high-availability cluster using this IP address when you wish to log into DiskStation Manager (DSM), regardless of which Synology server is the active server. This prevents from having to connect to different IP addresses after a switchover occurs.</li>
			<li><b>Subnet Mask: </b>The associated  subnet mask for the given high-availability cluster IP address.</li>
		</ul>
<h4>To  edit IP Address and Subnet mask:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Choose the IP address or subnet mask you wish to edit and click <b>Edit</b> or double click on the field to start editing.</li>
		<li>Check the <b>Enable</b> checkboxes to enable or disable each interface. You can enable more than one cluster network interface, but the original network interface that was configured during cluster creation cannot be disabled.</li>
	</ol>
<h4>To change the high-availability cluster server name:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Click<b> Change network settings</b> to view the high-availability cluster name and change its settings.</li>
		<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to save the current high-availability cluster name and IP address settings.</li>
		<li>To discard the current changes click <b>Cancel</b>.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Active and Passive Server Tabs (displayed as server name)</h3>
<p>These tabs show the status of network interfaces on the active or passive server. Of these, the Heartbeat connection will occupy one network interface on each of the active and passive servers. These tabs display the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Network Interface:</b> The physical network interface on the server.</li>
		<li><b>IP Address:</b> The assigned IP address for the given network interface.</li>
		<li><b>Subnet Mask:</b> The associated  subnet mask for the given IP address.</li>
		<li><b>Description:</b> Displays information of the given network interface and the accessibility of its assigned IP address. This field will show the following possible conditions:</li>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Accessible original IP address</b>: The original IP address assigned to the interface on the active server is accessible for data and services.</li>
			<li><b>Not accessible original IP address</b>: The original IP address assigned to the interface on the passive server is not accessible.</li>
			<li><b>Heartbeat connection IP, not accessible from the intranet</b>: The original IP address assigned automatically to the Heartbeat connection is not accessible for data and services.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
