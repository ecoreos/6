<h3>2-Step Verification</h3>

<p>2-step verification provides improved security for your DSM account. If 2-step verification is enabled, you will need to enter your password in addition to a one-time verification code when logging into DSM. Verification codes are obtained from authenticator apps installed on your mobile device. Therefore, if someone wants to access your account, he will not only need your username and password, but also your mobile device.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<p>2-step verification requires a mobile device and an authenticator app which supports the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) protocol. Authenticator apps include Google Authenticator (Android/iPhone/BlackBerry) or Authenticator (Windows Phone).</p>
</div>

<h4>To enable 2-step verification:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Personal</strong> > <strong>Account</strong> tab and tick the <strong>Enable 2-step verification</strong> box to launch the 2-step verification setup wizard.</li>
<li>On the first screen, enter an email address. Emergency verification codes can be sent to this email address in case your mobile device is lost.</li>
<li>Download and install an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator (Android/iPhone/BlackBerry) or Authenticator (Windows Phone).</li>
<li>On the following screen, open your authenticator app and scan the QR code. Alternatively, you can click the link to manually enter a secret key.</li>
<li>Next, your authenticator app generates a 6-digit verification code. Enter this code into the wizard text field in order to confirm configurations are correct. If an error occurs, please make sure the system time of your mobile device is synchronized with the system time of DSM. Also, verification codes are updated periodically, so make sure the code you enter has not expired.</li>
<li>Once the setup wizard is finished, click <strong>OK</strong> to save settings.</li>
</ol>



<h4>To log into DSM with 2-step verification:</h4>

<p>When 2-step verification is enabled, you will be prompted to enter a 6-digit verification code when logging into DSM.</p>

<ol>
<li>On the DSM login screen, enter your username and password as usual.</li>
<li>When prompted to enter a verification code, open the authenticator app on your mobile device.</li>
<li>Find and enter the 6-digit verification code for your account. If your mobile device is lost, you can click the <b>Lost phone?</b> link, and an emergency code will be sent to your email address.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMTP Settings:</strong> To receive emergency codes via email, SMTP server settings found in <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Notification</b> must be properly setup.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Code Limit:</strong> Each user has a limit of 5 emergency codes. If you exceed your limit, you will need to disable and enable 2-step verification before receiving any more emergency codes.</li>
<li>2-step verification can be enforced on DSM and all related Synology mobile applications (e.g. DSM mobile and DS file).</li>

</ul>
</div>


<h4>To reset users' 2-Step verification settings:</h4>

<p>Users belonging to the <strong>administrators</strong> group can reset the 2-step verification settings of other users. 
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>User</strong>.</li>
<li>Double-click the user whose 2-step verification you wish to reset.</li>
<li>On the <strong>User Information</strong> tab, click the button <strong>Reset 2-Step Verification</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section">

</div>


<h3>Account Activity</h3>
<p>Account activity displays the login activity of your DSM account, including current connections, trusted devices, and login history.</p>

<ul>
<li>You log in with the same account but on a different browser.</li>
