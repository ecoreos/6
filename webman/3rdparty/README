#
# you can add your own node in management UI. What you have to do is:
#
# 1. Create a directory under /usr/syno/synoman/webman/3rdparty
# 2. Put a file named "application.cfg" under the directory.
#
#
# The format of the application.cfg is:
#     text = The node name that would be showed in the tree.
#            If you would like to do localization, you can add abbreviation
#            of language in the suffix. For example, 
#            text_cht = Node name for Chinese language
#            text_fre = Node name for Franch
#            Other abbreviation (jpn, sve, spn,...) can be found at
#            /usr/syno/synoman/webman/texts/
#            If user use a language that can't be found here, we will use
#            "text" by default. So it is recommended you must set the "text"
#            as default for other languages.
#
#     description = The description of this node (will show when on mouse
#                   over and in the complete function list). This string
#                   can be localized, too. For example:
#                   description_cht = ...
#                   description_fre = ...
#
#     icon_16 = The icon path for tree icon. The icon must be put under
#               /usr/syno/synoman/webman/3rdparty/xxx/ where xxx is the
#               directory name of your module.
#               For example, if you create a directory named "images" and
#               put your icon in it. So full path of the icon is:
#               /usr/syno/synoman/webman/3rdparty/xxx/images/icon.png. Then
#               this value should be set to "images/icon.png".
#               (omit the/usr/syno/synoman/webman/3rdparty/xxx/)
#     icon_32 = The big icon path. This icon will be used in complete function
#               list mode.
#     type = The value can be "embedded" or "popup". "popup" means when click
#            on the node, we will popup a new window. The "embedded" means
#            open the url in the left frame of management UI just like other
#            Synology's function does.
#     protocol = The value can be "http" or "https". This is the url protocol
#                you would like to use. If this value is not set, we will
#                set it to current connection protocol.
#     address = The address of the url. If it is empty, we will use current
#               url which means the address will be the same with how user
#               connect to management UI.
#     port = The port number of the url. If this is not set, we will use the
#            port that user is connecting to the management UI.
#     path = The path part of the url.
#
#
#
# Example 1: If you would like to add a node named "My Node". When click
# on it, it popup a new windows to http://www.synology.com/index.php. I
# create a directory /usr/syno/synoman/webman/3rdparty/my_node and put my
# image in /usr/syno/synoman/webman/3rdparty/my_node/images/.
#
# Here is my configuration in /usr/syno/synoman/webman/3rdparty/my_node/application.cfg:
#     text = My Node
#     description = This is my node pointed to Synology WebSite
#     icon_16 = images/icon16.png
#     icon_32 = images/icon32.png
#     type = popup
#     protocol = http
#     address = www.synology.com
#     port = 80
#     path = /index.php
#
# Example 2: If you would like to add a node named "Second Node". When
# click on the node, it will show the Web Station (port 80) of this DS.
# Just don't set the "address". In this example, we don't specify icon
# so it will show default icons. Please create a directory and put a
# file application.cfg in it:
#
# Here is the configuration of application.cfg:
#     text = Second Node
#     description = Description of second node
#     type = embedded
#     protocol = http
#     port = 80
